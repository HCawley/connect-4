# connect-4

When a user clicks the column they want to play, a for loop checks the next available space in the column and plays the disk in that space. After each turn a for loop checks all four directions for four of the same colour disks consecutively - the winner is then alerted on the screen.
The board can be cleared by the "New game" button.
